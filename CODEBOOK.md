# Annotation Codebook: Suicidal Ideation Detection

## Overview
This codebook defines labels for binary (SI vs non-SI) and multiclass (SI, MH, NEU, HUMOR) classification of Reddit posts.

## Label Definitions

### SI (Suicidal Ideation)
**Definition**: First-person expressions of desire, intent, plan, or method to die or self-harm.

**Include**:
- Direct statements: "I want to die," "planning to end it"
- Indirect/passive: "better off dead," "no point in living"
- Method/plan mentions with self-reference

**Exclude**:
- Explicit denials: "not suicidal," "no ideation"
- Third-person only: "my friend is suicidal"
- Hypothetical without self-reference

**Examples**:
- Positive: "I keep thinking about taking all my pills"
- Positive: "I feel like Iâ€™m constantly postponing my inevitable suicide"
- Positive: "i donâ€™t want to die anymore but this time it looks like i might anyway"
- Positive: "i want to end it so badly, give me a reason not to."

- "How you'll manage this gurlss ðŸ˜­ðŸŽ€?"
- "To all the boys , here's how to get confident in front of girls"

### HUMOR (Humor/Sarcasm)

to revive your dead phone:"

they stop the class from
leaving after the bell rang"

hurts:

made with mematic"
- "It looks like a job for a gorilla"

## Decision Rules
- Negation: Mark non-SI if ideation explicitly denied
- Uncertainty: Route to adjudication if unclear; prefer SI if agency + desire present
- Third-person: Exclude from SI unless author self-discloses

## Ethics & Safety
- De-identify all content before annotation
- Paraphrase examples to reduce re-identification
- Annotator resources: [crisis line, support contacts]
- Escalate any identifiable imminent-risk content
