# Suicidal-Ideation-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Building a machine learning tool to detect suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicide attempts, suicide crisis, suicidal behavior, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) from textual data is a feasible and promising approach supported by recent research.

### Executive summary
- Dataset’s purpose: To support research and model development for detecting suicidal ideation in social media text amoung the young population suffering in silent     and maybe trying to express themsefls on online, enabling early-risk signals while prioritizing privacy, ethics, and harm reduction.
- Summarize sources
  target_subreddit = (
        'SI': ['SuicideWatch, 'selfharm', 'AdultSelfHarm'],  # High SI probability
        'MH': ['depression', 'BPD', 'Vent', 'mentalhealth', 'MentalHealthSupport', 'SelfHate'],  # Mental health with SI screening
        'NEU': ['college', 'collegeIndia', 'TwentiesIndia'], # For Netural behavior
        'HUMOR': ['teenagers', 'suicidebywords', 'memes', 'darkjokes','IndianDankMemes', 'dankmemes', '2meirl4meirl'] # For distingushing humor and SI ideation
    )
  labeling scheme (binary and multi-level):
  - Binary classes: Every post is labeled either “suicidal ideation” or “non‑suicidal,” nothing in between. This makes models easier to train and results simpler to      report, but it can’t tell apart different risk levels like passive thoughts, active intent, or plans. Binary labeling reduces annotation effort and class             imbalance complexity, providing a clean starting point for benchmarking before moving to multi‑level labels.

  - Multi‑level: multiple classes that capture risk levels or categories, such as Mental Health, Neutral and Humor, this offers richer signals for analysis and           multiple levels let models and analyses distinguish passive thoughts from planning or attempts, which is valuable for research on risk progression and triage         logic.
  preprocessing scope (de-identification, filtering, OCR for memes), and the intended use constraints (research, non-clinical).

### Background and motivation
- Briefly explain why suicidal ideation detection is studied (early identification can support triage/intervention), and why social media text is used (timeliness and scale with caution about biases and noise).
- Cite high-level evidence that modern NLP (deep learning and transformers) often outperforms traditional ML on this task but suffers from dataset biases, label reliability issues, and generalization concerns.

### Scope and intended use
- Intended use: research, benchmarking, method development for SI detection; explicitly not for clinical decision-making or real-time moderation without oversight and external validation.
- Out-of-scope: diagnosis, replacement of professionals, deployment without bias, safety, and drift assessments.

### Data sources
- Platforms and subreddits (e.g., r/SuicideWatch, r/depression, r/mentalhealth, r/Vent; adjust to the actual list collected), with collection windows and APIs/tools used for acquisition.[1][8]
- Include any other corpora used (e.g., public Twitter SI datasets if applicable) and note differences in domain and annotation practices.[4][5]

### Collection methodology
- Querying criteria: keywords, subreddit membership, time windows, filters (language=English, min length), and inclusion/exclusion rules (spam, bots, duplicates).[6][8]
- Multimodal handling: describe OCR pipeline for meme/text-in-image posts (tools, languages, confidence thresholds), alignment of extracted text with the post.[6][8]
- De-duplication: exact and near-duplicate logic (hashing, n-gram similarity), and cross-source overlap checks to prevent leakage across splits.[8][3]

### Data annotation and labels
- Label design: binary (SI vs non-SI) or multi-class severity (e.g., based on Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale mappings if used), and rationale.[9][3]
- Annotation process: automatic heuristics, keyword seeds, weak labels, or human labeling; inter-annotator agreement if applicable; adjudication steps; example edge cases.[3][8]
- Known label risks: keyword leakage, subreddit-as-label shortcuts, topic confounds; plan mitigations (balanced controls, adversarial splits, leakage checks).[8][3]

### Data schema
- Provide a precise field dictionary for each JSON/CSV row:  
  - id, platform, subreddit/community, created_utc, author_id (hashed), post_text, title, ocr_text, media_flags, language, label, prelim_label, source_split, char_len, token_len, toxicity/lexicon scores (if computed), and collection_date.[1][8]
- Include units, allowed values, and nullability for each field, plus versioned schema changes.[1][8]

### Preprocessing and normalization
- Text cleaning: URL/user/emoji handling, lowercasing policy, punctuation, whitespace, stopwords, and preservation of negations.[8]
- De-identification: remove usernames, emails, phone numbers, location hints; hashing IDs; note tradeoffs with context.[10][8]
- Language filtering and normalization strategies; tokenization baselines and max-len thresholds to avoid truncation bias.[8]

### Data splits and leakage prevention
- Train/validation/test split strategy: time-based, author-disjoint, and subreddit-disjoint variants to quantify generalization.[3][8]
- Document exact sizes and balancing per label per split; justify choices and record random seeds.[3][8]

### Bias, safety, and ethical considerations
- Risks: demographic bias, subreddit/topic confounds, performative language, and self-harm contagion concerns when exposing examples.[10][8]
- Mitigations: de-identification, sensitive content access controls, filtered example sharing, ethics review or advisory, and clear non-clinical use notice.[10][8]
- Harm-minimizing documentation: crisis resources note, annotation safety protocol, and usage terms requiring caution.[10][8]

### Licensing and access
- Data licensing summary: platform TOS compliance, redistribution stance (metadata vs raw text), and how to request controlled access if needed.[1][8]
- Derivative work policy: restrictions for commercial/clinical use and requirement to cite the dataset documentation.[8][10]

### Baseline tasks and evaluation
- Tasks: binary SI detection; optionally multi-level severity classification; domain transfer between subreddits/platforms.[9][8]
- Metrics: precision, recall, F1 (macro), ROC-AUC, PR-AUC; report per-class and macro to handle imbalance; include calibration assessment.[3][8]
- Splits to test: in-domain vs cross-domain; author-disjoint to avoid memorization; time-split to assess drift.[3][8]

### Baseline models
- Traditional ML: TF-IDF or n-grams with linear SVM/LogReg, plus feature ablations and leakage checks.[8]
- Deep learning: CNN/LSTM/C-LSTM baselines; note sequence length, pretrained embeddings, and regularization.[8]
- Transformers: fine-tune BERT/RoBERTa/ELECTRA and domain-adapt if necessary; report strong baselines but discuss label reliability and shortcut learning risks.[5][3]

### Robustness and generalization
- Stress tests: evaluate across subreddits, time periods, and content types (short vs long, OCR vs text-only) to expose shortcuts.[3][8]
- Domain shift: test on external datasets if allowed; discuss differences in annotation schemes and performance drops.[5][3]

### Explainability and interpretability
- Provide feature attribution examples (e.g., SHAP/Integrated Gradients) and discuss limitations and potential for false reassurance in clinical contexts.[2][10]
- Document common salient patterns and risky shortcuts (e.g., keyword over-reliance).[3][8]

### Reproducibility
- Versioning: dataset version, schema version, and changelog with added/removed records; frozen splits with hashes.[8]
- Code: scripts for collection, preprocessing, labeling, and evaluation; environment files; seed control and exact command logs.[8]

### Known limitations
- Coverage: platform/subreddit bias; language and cultural limitations; ambiguity of self-disclosure vs metaphor.[10][8]
- Label noise: weak labels and heuristic errors; steps taken and remaining risks; caution for deployment claims.[3][8]

### Citation and acknowledgments
- Provide a canonical citation for the dataset; acknowledge platform communities and any annotators/advisors.[1][8]

Practical next steps to finalize the documentation:
- Inventory the actual sources, date ranges, record counts, label distributions, and schema as currently collected; insert them into the above sections.[1][8]
- Lock author-disjoint and time-based splits; compute per-split stats and leak checks; freeze seeds and store split manifests.[3][8]
- Write an ethical use and access policy page with a clear non-clinical use disclaimer and instructions for requesting access, if controlled.[10][8]
- Add a Baselines section with one traditional ML, one LSTM/CNN, and one transformer fine-tune plan; reserve results slots to fill after preprocessing.[8][3]
